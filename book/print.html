<!-- To Do: Add links to words like Bash script -->
<h2 id="open-source"><a class="header" href="#open-source">Open Source</a></h2>
<p>Linux is open-source, meaning its source code can be accessed, modified, and distributed freely by the public under the GPL license. This allows for a collaborative development process and the ability for individuals to create their own versions of the software. Unlike proprietary software, users cannot access or modify the source code.</p>
<p>Open-source is a defining characteristic of Linux, as it was created with the intention of allowing users to freely make modifications and improvements. The concept of open-source was central to Linus Torvalds's vision for the operating system.</p>
<h2 id="portable"><a class="header" href="#portable">Portable</a></h2>
<p>Linux is a highly versatile operating system that can be found in a wide range of devices, thanks to its ability to run on various computer architectures. This portability is a key feature of Linux, it allows for easy transfer of code from one system to another. However, achieving this level of portability is not a one-time task, it requires a consistent effort in writing code that can be easily adapted to different systems.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, designed the operating system with portability in mind. He believed it was important for Linux to be supported on a wide variety of processors, which is why it still supports older Intel CPU processors.</p>
<p>Using Linux on various computers is also made easy with the bundled drivers included in Linux distros, which allows for use on almost any computer. Even if specific hardware like a GPU is not supported, open-source drivers can be easily installed to fix this.</p>
<h2 id="secure"><a class="header" href="#secure">Secure</a></h2>
<p>Linux is known for its high level of security, as it is rarely affected by malware such as viruses and worms. This makes it a highly secure operating system, so much so that antivirus software is rarely needed or sold for Linux systems. There are several reasons for this inherent security in Linux, including its open-source nature, which allows for a large community of developers to review and improve the code, making it harder for malware to infiltrate the system.</p>
<p>Security has been a fundamental aspect of the Linux operating system from its inception, with each user isolated from others, requiring a password and user ID for access. Additionally, users have limited automatic access rights, making it harder for malware to spread. The open-source format with multiple operating environments, system architectures, and components, such as different email clients, also makes it more difficult for malware to spread throughout the system.</p>
<h2 id="developer-friendly"><a class="header" href="#developer-friendly">Developer Friendly</a></h2>
<p>Linux supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, CSS, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Vala. While there may be some issues at times, it generally provides a smooth experience for programmers. If a programming language is not specific to a particular operating system, it is likely to work on Linux. However, it is always recommended to do proper research before starting to ensure compatibility. In case of support issues, the required packages can usually be obtained from Linux's distribution repositories.</p>
<p>Linux also provides various useful and time-saving text editors for programmers, in addition to the basic text file option. It also allows for &quot;Bash scripting&quot; using Linux commands for specific programming needs.</p>
<h2 id="customization"><a class="header" href="#customization">Customization</a></h2>
<p>Without question, Linux is one of the most customizable operating systems available.

An operating system consists of an underlying kernel, applications, and often a graphical user interface. Linux is the kernel, and all operating systems that use it are called "Linux distributions." The term "distribution" comes from the process of sharing Linux-based OSes with other users, also known as "distributing" since the kernel and the OS are generally free.
<p>Linux is Open Source and licensed under the GNU General Public License, which gives freedom to build Operating Systems on it.
Many people have their set of requirements from an OS. Tech savvy people like to customize and tweak existing desktops. Thats why there are thoudands of Linux Distros we have.</p>

  <h1 align="center"><b>Desktop Environment</b></h1>
<b>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">desktop environment</a>  is a complete ecosystem of software and resources providing a homogeneous graphical user experience.</b>
<p>Generally based on specific graphical widgets, configuration system, root window with desktop background, taskbar with window list and menu, icons, <a href="DesktopEnv/desktopenv.html#">window manager</a> etc. It provides a coherent visual metaphor for a user to interact with the computer.</p>
<p>There are many Desktop environments, that users can easily install on their systems. You can customize them your way with custom themes, widgets and other applications, available free and open source.</p>
