<center><h1>Linux is Everywhere</h1></center>

Linux can be found in a wide range of devices, from kitchen appliances to spacecraft, due to its ability to be ported to various computer architectures, making it highly versatile and adaptable.

## Servers
Servers are a critical component of modern IT infrastructure, and Linux is a popular choice for servers due to its many advantages.

Linux servers are a popular choice for many IT organizations due to their stability, security, and flexibility. The wide range of web servers that run on Linux makes it a versatile platform to host various types of web applications and services.

### Popular web servers
Linux servers are used by many popular web servers, such as Apache and Nginx, which are known for their high performance, scalability, and security. These web servers are widely used to host websites and web applications, and they are compatible with a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.

## Embedded systems
Embedded systems are specialized devices that perform specific functions, such as routers, set-top boxes, and other appliances. They typically have limited resources and require a small footprint and low power consumption.
Linux is a popular choice for embedded systems such as routers and set-top boxes due to its small footprint, low power consumption, customizability, community support, and compatibility with a range of hardware platforms. It can run on devices with limited resources and can be tailored to meet specific requirements.

## Automotive
Modern vehicles are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and they rely on advanced technology to provide a wide range of features and services. Linux is widely used in automotive applications, such as infotainment systems and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), due to its many advantages such as its scalability, customizability, security, interoperability and community support. It can handle sensitive data and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different vehicles.

## Robotics
 Linux is widely used in robotics and automation systems due to its customizability, interoperability, reliability, and security. The open-source nature of Linux allows for easy integration with other systems, making it a versatile choice for industrial automation.

 ## Gaming
 Linux has been used as the underlying operating system for some popular gaming consoles like the PlayStation 2 and 3. This is due to its flexibility, customizability, and compatibility with a wide range of hardware platforms. Additionally, Linux allows for easy integration with other systems and its open-source nature allows for developers to have more control over the system.

## Mobile Devices
Linux is widely used in mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, due to its customizability, interoperability, security, scalability and community support. The Android operating system, which is based on the Linux kernel, is the most widely used mobile operating system in the world.

## In Super Computers
In the past, most supercomputers ran on Unix, but over time, Linux has become the preferred operating system for these powerful machines.\
According to the latest report from Top 500, all 500 of the world's fastest supercomputers now run on Linux.

Supercomputers are built for specific purposes, which require an operating system that is tailored to meet those needs. Unix, being a closed-source proprietary system, can be costly when it comes to customization. In contrast, Linux is open-source and therefore can be easily customized to suit the specific requirements of each supercomputer. Engineering teams can take advantage of the flexibility of Linux to create a customized operating system that is optimized for the specific needs of each supercomputer.

## Space Programs
Linux can be found not only on Earth but also in space, including on Mars. NASA relies heavily on Linux for various purposes, such as storing data sent from satellites and telescopes and processing that data for research institutions and the general public. NASA's use of Linux and open-source software is a testament to the versatility and adaptability of the Linux kernel and its related software ecosystem.
