<h1 align="center"><b>Linux Distributions</b></h1>
An operating system consists of an underlying kernel, applications, and often a graphical user interface. Linux is the kernel, and all operating systems that use it are called "Linux distributions." The term "distribution" comes from the process of sharing Linux-based OSes with other users, also known as "distributing" since the kernel and the OS are generally free.

Linux is Open Source and licensed under the GNU General Public License, which gives freedom to build Operating Systems on it.
Many people have their set of requirements from an OS. Tech savvy people like to customize and tweak existing desktops. Thats why there are thoudands of Linux Distros we have.
